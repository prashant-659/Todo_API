# Todo_API

This project implements a Todo_API that uses Django REST Framework. Todo_API back-end contains both a lost API endpoint for all todos and dedicated endpoints for each individual todo. 

I will elaborate the implementation of the project.  To run the project on your local device, clone the repository, open the PowerShell and go to the repository where python manage.py file exists. Run the command, python manage.py runserver. 

A server URL will appear on the screen that goes like http://127.0.0.1:8000/api. Go to the link that will take you to all todos page of the API. To open enpoints for an individual API, use the link http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/1.
